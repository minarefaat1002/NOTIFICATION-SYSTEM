Here's a video of testing the project on linkedin [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7175862124219437056/)
# The tech stack:
## 🐳 Docker 
Containerized the microservices to ensure easy deployment and scalability across environments.
## 🐍 Django
Used Django as the main framework to handle the server-side logic and provide a reliable foundation.
## 🌐 WebSockets
By integrating websockets into the application, we unlock the power of real-time updates. Persistent connections between the server and clients eliminate 
the need for frequent polling, resulting in a seamless, responsive, and engaging user experience.
## 🐇 RabbitMQ
A vital component of the architecture, RabbitMQ acts as a reliable and efficient message broker. It enables asynchronous messaging between different parts of the system, ensuring 
seamless communication and decoupling of tasks. With RabbitMQ, the service achieves optimal performance and scalability. 
## 🛠️ Celery Workers
The integration of Celery with RabbitMQ introduces asynchronous task processing. By leveraging Celery's capabilities, we offload time-consuming tasks to separate workers, 
reducing response times and enhancing overall system efficiency.
